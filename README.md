## User experience portfolio

### Keepmebooked: B2B Property Management Software
Our business objective was to transition the product from focusing on customers in the hotel industry to those in the vacation rental industry. This migration also came with the technical challenge of scaling a legacy codebase to a userbase of 50,000+ (from under 1,000).

**My role**: Hands-on Managing Director leading a team of 10 developers and designers.
**Platform**: Web & Native Mobile.

!> **Task #1**: understanding the customer

`customer development` `interviews` `key jobs` `pains` `gains`


**Understanding the customer**
```
1. 📝 Interview target customers
2. 🔎 Discover key jobs, pains and gains
3. 👥 Identify customer segments
```

> Interview target customers 📝

I conducted over 20 hours of interviews in person and on Skype with vacation rental customers to understand their distinct needs.

> Discover key jobs, pains and gains 🔎

From those interviews, customer key jobs, pains and gains were identified. This information was used to determine our core product and the changes needed to make to the existing product suitable.

*Key customer jobs, pains and gains for one customer segment*


> Identify customer segments 👥

Due to this research and analysis 3 customer segments were defined as well as the features and benefits of value:

1. Owners of 1 property
2. Multiple property owners (2 - 20 properties)
3. Operator/manager (5 - 40 properties)


 With these segments we were able to determine our product roadmap and develop our business model with great confidence. Initally we focused on the second segment as our existing product could be shaped to match their requirements without huge difficulty. The first segment was ruled out as the majority of users did not need a solution like Keepmebooked and those that did would not support our business model.
